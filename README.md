# SWN Sector Manager

Software for keeping notes on Sectors in pen & paper rpg Stars Without Number with a graphical UI.
Current features:
* Place stars and planets in hexes. Latter contain fields for keeping notes on their features.
* Keep notes on factions and their assets. Currently it is possible to make simple moves with assets.

Future plans involve modifying code style to be consistent across the whole project, adding support for playing faction turns and possibly automatic sector generation.
